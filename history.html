        Chapter 1 - The Foundation
        <hr>

        The official foundation date of the modern Church is considered 15th of November, 2020. However, the prejudicies for establishing the Church
        appeared much before. The oldest one is dated 10/9/2020.

        After some time and careful conversations between its members, the Old Church had finally come into its existence.

        <hr>

        It was no more than a couple of adherents though. Raxus still was there, but Old Church was incabaple of further expansion.<br>

        <br>It was abandoned.<br><br>
        

        That was the beginning of the Church as we know it now. Again, first this was just some small unite.
        Then, he came. Yes, Raxus. And in only several words he could include more sense, more meaning, than some famous writers share in all their books altogether.
        One of his first words upon Modern Church were:

        <hr>
        "Why did you do this"
        <hr>

        This question is rather complicated to answer, still the answer is simple. The Church is here because social communities tend to make unions
        and because people are mostly driven by their dreams and desires. Come on, if no one makes that Raxus Church, lets make it a real thing ourselves! You know,
        Raxus maybe is not someone superior, but definitely the one who made people unite. And even you can do that! Invite your friends to the Church and make society frendlier!

        Chapter 2

        <hr>
        Eggs?
        <hr>

        Are you wondering what a *egg is? We're also! "This question had been sent to a group of scientists once".
        <br>- What is that, Mr. Scientist?
        <br>- We have no clue, Mr. Interviewer. Our conclusion hence is simple. *egg is just a *egg. Nothing more.
